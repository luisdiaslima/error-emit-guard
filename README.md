# Error Emit Guard: Shielding Your Code!

## Powered by Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite: The Dynamic Trio

The Error Emit Guard is a demonstration project showcasing the integration of error reporting functionality into a Vue.js web application. Developed using Vue.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Sentry, this application features a simplistic login page designed to simulate user authentication. The primary objective of this project is to illustrate the seamless integration of Sentry's error reporting capabilities within a Vue.js application.

### Unveiling the Power Within

Behind the sleek facade lies a robust architecture. Harnessing the prowess of Vue 3 `<script setup>` Single File Components (SFCs), this template leverages the latest innovations to supercharge your development journey. Dive into the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to unlock the secrets of this cutting-edge approach.

### Recommended Setup

- **Sentry Integration:** Arm yourself with Sentry's shield by creating a `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file. Equip it with your authentication token under the watchful eye of the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` variable. Let no error slip past unnoticed!

- **Optimized Tooling:** Navigate the treacherous terrain of code with finesse using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Equip it with the [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension (formerly Volar) and bid farewell to Vetur. Your arsenal is now complete!

- **Enhanced Type Checking:** Empower your troops with the formidable [vue-tsc](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc). Command them to wield the same type checking prowess from the command line or to generate d.ts files for SFCs. Victory is within reach!
